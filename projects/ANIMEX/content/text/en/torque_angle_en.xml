    <textFormat font="Arial" size="10" color="#000000" align="left">A screw joint shall always be tightened with the correct torque according to the specification. <br />The pre-stress that is build up in the screw joint gives the clamping force. The clamping force gives the friction between two components, which holding them together  <br /><br />To give the screw joint reinforcement a determined pre stressing force it is possible to turn the screw/nut with a certain angle. This method gives a nearly absolute safety since the screw is tightened close to its own yield point.<br /><br />Explain what happens if the screw is over tightened or too much angle tightening is applied.<br /><br />Use the angle tightening to ensure that you get the correct clamping force without having to retighten later on.</textFormat>
